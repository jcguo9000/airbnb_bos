This code is apply to solve three questions regarding Airbnb in Boston from the opensource data:

    1. Can we build a model to predict the listing price in Boston using the variables (e.g. location, property type, etc.) in the opensource data?
    2. How does geo-location affects the listing price?
    3. How seasonality affect the price of the Airbnb listings in Boston?
